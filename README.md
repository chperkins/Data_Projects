# energy_model_train.ipynb

This file contains the main code for my current University of Chicago master's thesis. Its main purpose is to expand upon other energy based model neural networks to include more hyperparameter options. Elements like spectral normalization, learning rate, and several other components can be changed, enabled, and disabled at the beginning of the file. The code outputs images directly into subdirectories of a google drive as the model trains. It also outputs several diagonstics. Ideally, these models should be run with a TPU to decrease training time. This code is designed to run in Google Colab.

# MNIST_project.ipynb

This jupyter notebook downloads MNIST data and runs some statistical analysis. It explores running PCA on the images, spectral clustering, and logistic regression on principal components. I use the benchmark MNIST data as a tool to experiment with these statistical tools.
